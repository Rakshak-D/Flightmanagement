# 🚀 Flight Information Display System (FIDS)  
**Simulating the working of airport FIDS using Data Structures**

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This repository contains the implementation of a **Flight Information Display System (FIDS)**, developed as part of the **Data Structures and Applications** course at Malnad College of Engineering. The project leverages structured programming to manage and query flight data efficiently.

1. **User Account Management**:  
   - Secure login and account creation.  
   - Password validation with retries for failed attempts.  

2. **Flight Search Options**:  
   - **Direct Flights**: Find flights directly connecting two cities.  
   - **Indirect Flights**: Search for 1-stop and 2-stop connecting flights.  
   - **Cheapest Routes**: Identify the most cost-effective flights.  

3. **Comprehensive Data Handling**:  
   - Load and manage flight, city, and user data from CSV files.  

4. **Interactive User Interface**:  
   - User-friendly prompts and menu navigation.
